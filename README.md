- Add `javadoc` compliant documentation (https://www.oracle.com/uk/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) to class, methods, properties of interest 
- When done, fill out title and description and select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`.
- Click `Propose changes` and wait for review.

Adding documentation from a local repository:

- Fork this repository and clone it locally.
- Add documentation as needed.
- Push your changes to your fork.
- Create a merge request and go through review and merge process.

Once your changes have been accepted (you may be asked for edits) they will be merged to main repo and the documentation will be updated.
